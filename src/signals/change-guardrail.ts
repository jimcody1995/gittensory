// Convergence safety: the hard-guardrail path check for the auto-maintain layer (#778). Changed paths that

// that touches a guarded path (scoring / auth / CI workflows / policy scripts, etc.). Ported verbatim from
// reviewbot core/change-classifier.ts — the mechanism that prevents the awesome-claude #4196 incident class
// (a weakened policy script auto-merging because its path wasn't guarded). Pure + dependency-free.

// Canonicalize a path or glob so matching is case- and separator-insensitive: backslashes → `/`, drop a
// leading `./` or `/`, and case-fold. Mirrors signals/focus-manifest `normalizePathForMatch` — without it a
// guarded path is evaded with `.github/Workflows/` (capital W), a `./`-prefix, or a `\` separator, turning a
// mandatory human hold on CI/policy files into an auto-merge.

// globToRegExp's COMPILATION is linear-time, but the COMPILED pattern's .test() can be polynomial-to-exponential
// on an adversarial near-miss input once MULTIPLE wildcard GROUPS chain in one glob (a "group" is one `*` OR
// one `**` — a `**` pair compiles to a SINGLE `.*`, not two independent wildcards, so it must be counted as ONE
// group, not two characters; see countWildcardGroups below). Both group types contribute to the same danger once
// chained. MAX_GLOB_WILDCARD_GROUPS = 2 is the highest compiled backtracking-group count empirically proven safe
// (benchmarked 2026-07-01: sub-second even at wildly implausible adversarial path lengths; 3+ groups reach
// multi-second hangs within a few thousand characters — see test/unit/change-guardrail.test.ts's SECURITY
// (ReDoS) cases for the exact numbers). The cap lives INSIDE globToRegExp itself (not just in a wrapper like
// matchesAny below) so every caller — present or future, direct or indirect, including
